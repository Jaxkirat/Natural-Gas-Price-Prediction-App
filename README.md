## Introduction

The **Natural Gas Price Prediction** application uses historical data to predict the price of natural gas on a given date. This app leverages machine learning, specifically a Decision Tree Regressor, to provide accurate price forecasts based on day, month, and year inputs.

## Features

- Predict natural gas prices based on historical data
- Interactive date input using a modern date picker
- Clean and modern UI with background video and smooth animations
- Visualization of price trends over different time periods
